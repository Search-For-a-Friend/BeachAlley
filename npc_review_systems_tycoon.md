# NPC Review Systems in Tycoon Games

## Overview

Most modern tycoon and management games implement some form of
**simulated reputation system**, but none fully replicate a real-world
platform like Google Reviews or TripAdvisor.

These systems are usually internal, procedural, and designed for
gameplay balance rather than realism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Existing Systems in Games

### 1. Star Rating Systems (Core Layer)

Almost all management games use star ratings generated from internal
metrics:

-   Visitor satisfaction
-   Waiting time
-   Pricing
-   Cleanliness
-   Service quality
-   Ambience

Examples: - Two Point Hospital / Campus - Planet Coaster / Zoo - Game
Dev Tycoon - Hotel Magnate

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Procedural Text Reviews (Flavor Layer)

Some games generate short text feedback using templates:

> "Great atmosphere but too crowded."\
> "Service was slow, drinks were amazing."

These are not true AI, just rule-based generation.

Examples: - Software Inc. - Parkitect - Startup Company - The Tenants

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Persona-Based Reviewers

More advanced systems simulate user profiles:

Each NPC has: - Personality (tourist, local, VIP, influencer) -
Preferences - Social impact weight

Examples: - Planet Zoo - Cities: Skylines II - Mad Games Tycoon 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Does Not Exist Yet

No mainstream game offers:

-   Scrollable social feed
-   Persistent user profiles
-   Review trends
-   Viral events
-   Review manipulation
-   Influencer economies

A true "Google Reviews simulator" does not exist in commercial games.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design Opportunities

### Tier 1 -- Basic System

-   Stars
-   3--5 procedural comments
-   Reputation score

### Tier 2 -- Modern System

-   NPC personas
-   Influencers
-   Trend detection
-   Review decay

### Tier 3 -- Innovative System

-   Fake social platform
-   Review bombing
-   PR campaigns
-   Scandals
-   Viral nights
-   Long-term memory

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Industry Reality

Reasons this is rare: - Design complexity - Balancing realism vs fun -
Hard to visualize clearly - Most studios settle for stars

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

NPC review systems exist, but are shallow.

A deep social review simulation would be: - Innovative - Technically
feasible - Highly valuable for nightlife, resort, and service games

This is a genuine design gap in the tycoon genre.
